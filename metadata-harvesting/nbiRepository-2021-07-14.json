Some crab species also have commercial and recreational importance. Seagrass beds are permanent habitat and nurseries for important fishery species. Changing crab population dynamics have the potential to affect the balance and health of seagrass bed environments of Nantucket. Here I set out to document the current abundance of crab within a Nantucket seagrass bed. How crab species diversity in Nantucket seagrass is effected by seagrass density and the seagrass proximity to a marsh is evaluated. Crab species have the potential to impact other crab species placement within the seagrass, therefore the relationships between crabs species found were evaluated. Four strands of baited crab pots were placed three times for twenty four hour soaks for ten weeks. Crab number and species were recorded. A seine net was used to capture species and sizes not captured by the baited pots. The study found five crab species Libinia dubia, Carcinus maenas, Callinectes sapidus, Ovalipes ocellatus. C. maenas, an invasive species, was found to be a significant percentage of the total crab population. The study found no evidence that marsh proximity or seagrass density affects crab diversity with all five species found at all locations. Increased crab population was found proximate to the marsh entrance. Effects of seagrass density were less distinct and varied by species. An avoidance relationship was found between C. sapidus, C. maenas and L. dubia. The most distinct negative relationship was between C. sapidus and C. maenas and L. dubia. Observation of pots containing C. sapidus showed evidence of inter and intra species predation. These finding suggest changes in seagrass density located near marshes and shifts in species, such as an increase in C. Sapidus, would have a significant impact on total crab population and dynamics.</p>", "doi": "10.5281/zenodo.4050417", "keywords": ["animalia", "marine fauna", "nantucket", "nantucket harbor", "university of massachusetts field station", "population survey", "crab traps", "nbi grant"], "language": "eng", "license": "CC-BY-4.0", "prereserve_doi": {"doi": "10.5281/zenodo.4050417", "recid": 4050417}, "publication_date": "2018-02-15", "publication_type": "report", "related_identifiers": [{"identifier": "10.5281/zenodo.4050416", "relation": "isVersionOf", "scheme": "doi"}], "subjects": [{"identifier": "https://www.gbif.org/species/637", "scheme": "url", "term": "Decapoda"}], "title": "Factors Influencing Crab Species Abundance in New England Seagrass Beds", "upload_type": "publication"}, "modified": "2020-09-26T12:26:51.501358+00:00", "owner": 91267, "record_id": 4050417, "state": "done", "submitted": true, "title": "Factors Influencing Crab Species Abundance in New England Seagrass Beds"}, {"conceptdoi": "10.5281/zenodo.4050408", "conceptrecid": "4050408", "created": "2020-09-25T18:33:42.407445+00:00", "doi": "10.5281/zenodo.4050409", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4050409", "files": [{"checksum": "ba9a7e3be88adcbfcbc35efb4a8ebc09", "filename": "simmons-nbi-report-2019.pdf", "filesize": 400860, "id": "ef39baec-4291-4078-8e51-f2ea8d84fbbf", "links": {"download": "https://zenodo.org/api/files/e52a26a8-e95e-4bb6-8d5c-19df7672c7d4/simmons-nbi-report-2019.pdf", "self": "https://zenodo.org/api/deposit/depositions/4050409/files/ef39baec-4291-4078-8e51-f2ea8d84fbbf"}}], "id": 4050409, "links": {"badge": "https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.4050409.svg", "bucket": "https://zenodo.org/api/files/e52a26a8-e95e-4bb6-8d5c-19df7672c7d4", "conceptbadge": "https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.4050408.svg", "conceptdoi": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4050408", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4050409", "html": "https://zenodo.org/record/4050409", "latest": "https://zenodo.org/api/records/4050409", "latest_html": "https://zenodo.org/record/4050409", "self": "https://zenodo.org/api/records/4050409"}, "metadata": {"access_right": "open", "communities": [{"identifier": "nantucketbiodiversity"}], "creators": [{"affiliation": "Simmons Stewardship and Conservation Ecology", "name": "Simmons, Tim"}], "description": "<p>Submitted in fulfillment of a 2018 Nantucket Biodiversity Initiative grant.<br>\n<br>\nSandy beaches with reduced or complete prohibitions on vehicle use were identified for sampling in consultation with Nantucket Conservation Foundation (NCF) and Nantucket Islands Land Bank (NILB) staff.

The genus, first described by Simon (Simon,1884) currently has 7 described members (van Helsdingen, 2015). Intermittent sampling by prior arachnologists (Draney and McKenna-Foster pers. comm.), and by the author, yielded 5 males of this undescribed species on Nantucket Island (from Ram Pasture and Squam Swamp) from 2015-2017. Spiders of this genus are small (1.6 mm to 2.2 mm in length), males have slightly raised eye regions, and rather small eyes relative to other members of the Linyphiidae. Abdomen coloration is usually black to brownish-grey with yellow tinged legs. The genus is most commonly collected in Scandinavian countries, with two species, Tiso aestivus and Tiso vagans, being found in North America. Sampling of the above natural areas on Nantucket generated 0 new specimens that could be used for the description of the species this past season.

We expanded on mist-netting, radio-tracking, and acoustic survey efforts from 2016 to better characterize northern long-eared bat behavior and habitat use on the island. We also partnered with graduate students from UNH and UAlbany to collect swab and tissue samples for WNS and genetic testing. We captured a total of 36 bats, all northern long-eareds, and tagged 13 individuals. In July, we tracked 6 bats to a total of 9 roosts located within 3 km of their capture location. Bats were found roosting in mature pitch pine trees and snags, as well as under shingles or trim boards on houses sided with cedar shingles.

Research in other plant systems has investigated whether the presence of a non-native can affect native pollination, and the results have been mixed. A native may be negatively affected, may not be affected or may be positively affected by the presence of the non-native. In 2015 A population survey was performed on D. carota, and a pollinator observation study was performed on D. carota and a native species, Sericocarpus asteroides (Toothed White-top Aster). Pollinators were observed for three hours per day and five days each for the two species individually and both species cohabitating together. In 2016, additional populations were added to the D. carota population survey, and a removal treatment was performed on sites where both species cohabitate. On day one, the sites were observed as described, however, D. carota umbels were then removed from the site, and on the following day, pollinators were observed on S. asteroides. In addition, S. asteroides populations from a range of distances from D. carota were assayed for the presence and degree of heterospecific pollen. We had four hypotheses: 1) D. carota would be present across Nantucket Island; 2) The presence of D. carota would increase pollinator visitation rates and diversity indices on S. asteroides; 3) The removal of D. carota would restore pollinator visitation rates and diversity indices to those found on sites with only S. asteroides; 4) Higher levels of heterospecific pollination would be found in S. asteroides populations located close to D. carota. We found D. carota to be abundant across the island. While both plant species are generalist-pollinated, D. carota attracted 15 insect families and S. asteroides attracted only 8, with the majority being flies and bees. Each removal treatment received at least 50 % fewer pollinator visits after D. carota was removed, and the analysis on heterospecific pollination is currently on-going.</p>", "doi": "10.5281/zenodo.4029272", "keywords": ["plantae", "flora", "nantucket", "tuckernuck", "population survey", "field observation", "field experiment", "nbi grant", "invertebrates", "impact study"], "language": "eng", "license": "CC-BY-4.0", "notes": "The New England Botanical Club also funded this work through a Graduate Student Research Award", "prereserve_doi": {"doi": "10.5281/zenodo.4029272", "recid": 4029272}, "publication_date": "2017-02-15", "publication_type": "report", "related_identifiers": [{"identifier": "10.3119/18-11", "relation": "isContinuedBy", "resource_type": "publication-article", "scheme": "doi"}, {"identifier": "10.5281/zenodo.4029264", "relation": "continues", "resource_type": "publication-report", "scheme": "doi"}, {"identifier": "10.1371/journal.pone.0161971", "relation": "isContinuedBy", "resource_type": "publication-article", "scheme": "doi"}, {"identifier": "10.5281/zenodo.4029271", "relation": "isVersionOf", "scheme": "doi"}], "subjects": [{"identifier": "https://www.gbif.org/species/3034742", "scheme": "url", "term": "Daucus carota"}, {"identifier": "https://www.gbif.org/species/3088830", "scheme": "url", "term": "Sericocarpus asteroides"}], "title": "A Survey of Queen Anne's Lace on Nantucket and an Assessment of its Effect on Native Pollination, Year Two", "upload_type": "publication"}, "modified": "2020-09-15T00:59:28.416869+00:00", "owner": 91267, "record_id": 4029272, "state": "done", "submitted": true, "title": "A Survey of Queen Anne's Lace on Nantucket and an Assessment of its Effect on Native Pollination, Year Two"}, {"conceptdoi": "10.5281/zenodo.4029263", "conceptrecid": "4029263", "created": "2020-09-14T17:46:18.197361+00:00", "doi": "10.5281/zenodo.4029264", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4029264", "files": [{"checksum": "1f6a90ff87d1ef1ff70ae7ab190ff702", "filename": "ramsey-mandel-nbi-report-2016.pdf", "filesize": 1014179, "id": "d53fc4ee-6834-451c-b70e-3d5d096457ac", "links": {"download": "https://zenodo.org/api/files/7c071483-4788-4796-bbc3-63764c40ae22/ramsey-mandel-nbi-report-2016.pdf", "self": "https://zenodo.org/api/deposit/depositions/4029264/files/d53fc4ee-6834-451c-b70e-3d5d096457ac"}}], "id": 4029264, "links": {"badge": "https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.4029264.svg", "bucket": "https://zenodo.org/api/files/7c071483-4788-4796-bbc3-63764c40ae22", "conceptbadge": "https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.4029263.svg", "conceptdoi": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4029263", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4029264", "html": "https://zenodo.org/record/4029264", "latest": "https://zenodo.org/api/records/4029264", "latest_html": "https://zenodo.org/record/4029264", "self": "https://zenodo.org/api/records/4029264"}, "metadata": {"access_right": "open", "communities": [{"identifier": "nantucketbiodiversity"}], "creators": [{"affiliation": "University of Memphis", "name": "Ramsey, Adam J."}, {"affiliation": "University of Memphis", "name": "Mandel, Jennifer R."}], "description": "<p>Submitted in fulfillment of a 2015 Nantucket Biodiversity Initiative grant.

Research in other plant systems has investigated whether native pollination was affected by the presence of a non-native, and the results have been mixed.

Following this, a pollination observation study was performed on QAL and a native species, Toothed White-top Aster (Sericocarpus asteroides, TWTA), as the native&rsquo;s morphology and life history appeared to put it at risk of the effect of presence of QAL.

Recent experiments indicate that predators are likely key interactors along salt marsh creek banks but the identity and relative importance of common cross ecosystem predators are unknown and likely vary from marsh to marsh. Surveys in 2014 indicate that salt marshes of Nantucket host a diverse suite of predators including marine (e.g. green crabs, blue crabs, American eels, mummichogs) and terrestrial species, (e.g. shorebird predators such as Great Egrets, gulls, American Oystercatchers, Greater Yellowlegs, Willets, and Whimbrels). I used a combination of surveys, tethering experiments, and a manipulative field experiment to answer the following questions: (1) What are the most common predators of creek bank invertebrates in Nantucket salt marshes? and (2) What is the relative importance of shorebird and marine predators on the community structure and ecosystem functioning of Nantucket marshes? Preliminary results indicate that marine predators such as green crabs and blue crabs are likely keystone predators of marsh crabs, whereas bird predation is periodic. Marine predators have the largest affect on the marsh community, decreasing crab, mussel, and juvenile snail abundances. These same predators, likely green crabs and blue crabs and eels, also increase Spartina primary production. Determining the frequency and importance of cross ecosystem predators on creek bank processes will help understand how Nantucket salt marshes function and provision ecosystem services like erosion protection and nursery habitat availability.</p>", "doi": "10.5281/zenodo.4025428", "keywords": ["marine fauna", "nantucket", "medouie creek", "folger's marsh", "eel point", "point count", "tethering experiment", "nbi grant", "ecosystem study", "fish traps"], "language": "eng", "license": "CC-BY-4.0", "prereserve_doi": {"doi": "10.5281/zenodo.4025428", "recid": 4025428}, "publication_date": "2016-02-15", "publication_type": "report", "related_identifiers": [{"identifier": "10.5281/zenodo.4025427", "relation": "isVersionOf", "scheme": "doi"}], "title": "How do cross-ecosystem interactions affect Nantucket salt marsh food web structure and ecosystem functioning?", "upload_type": "publication"}, "modified": "2020-09-12T00:59:27.988608+00:00", "owner": 91267, "record_id": 4025428, "state": "done", "submitted": true, "title": "How do cross-ecosystem interactions affect Nantucket salt marsh food web structure and ecosystem functioning?"}, {"conceptdoi": "10.5281/zenodo.4025425", "conceptrecid": "4025425", "created": "2020-09-11T23:20:05.877154+00:00", "doi": "10.5281/zenodo.4025426", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4025426", "files": [{"checksum": "ae35c2c0684fe0675694035f33cde313", "filename": "lombardi-et-al-nbi-report-2015.pdf", "filesize": 4670023, "id": "fcd54c25-c7a7-48be-a170-a8606bf05fd4", "links": {"download": "https://zenodo.org/api/files/32b46211-89cf-47b0-baa7-9c86a8fe0b59/lombardi-et-al-nbi-report-2015.pdf", "self": "https://zenodo.org/api/deposit/depositions/4025426/files/fcd54c25-c7a7-48be-a170-a8606bf05fd4"}}], "id": 4025426, "links": {"badge": "https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.4025426.svg", "bucket": "https://zenodo.org/api/files/32b46211-89cf-47b0-baa7-9c86a8fe0b59", "conceptbadge": "https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.4025425.svg", "conceptdoi": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4025425", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4025426", "html": "https://zenodo.org/record/4025426", "latest": "https://zenodo.org/api/records/4025426", "latest_html": "https://zenodo.org/record/4025426", "self": "https://zenodo.org/api/records/4025426"}, "metadata": {"access_right": "open", "communities": [{"identifier": "nantucketbiodiversity"}], "creators": [{"affiliation": "University of Massachusetts Herbarium", "name": "Lombardi, C.

To explore any potential &quot;halo&quot; effect around mooring scars for seagrass or epifauna and to seek any difference in epifaunal community between mooring and reference sites I also sampled paired sites at eight locations in Nantucket Harbor, Massachusetts three times each in the summer of 2015. Each location consisted of a meadow site actively experiencing mooring scarring and a reference site without moorings. My conservative sampling methods of the 30 sampled mooring scars found scars to average 21.1m2. Across my paired sites, seagrass was found to have lower cover and lower canopy height in mooring versus reference sites. Seagrass cover and canopy height were lower in the first few meters (typically 2-3m) surrounding each scar in comparison to paired reference quadrats indicating a &quot;halo&quot; effect of each scar. I did not detect a difference in epifaunal community composition or density per blade between mooring and reference sites; however, the relatively constant per blade concentration of epifauna combined with the differences in seagrass biomass between the mooring versus reference sites indicate an overall increase in the total amount of epifauna in areas with less disturbance. Epifaunal community composition was different and between locations and sampling dates indicating these factors are more important than proximity to mooring scarring in determining epifaunal abundance and richness.&quot;</p>", "doi": "10.5281/zenodo.4012714", "keywords": ["plantae", "invertebrates", "marine flora", "nantucket", "impact study", "hand collection", "nbi grant", "nantucket harbor"], "language": "eng", "license": "CC-BY-4.0", "prereserve_doi": {"doi": "10.5281/zenodo.4012714", "recid": 4012714}, "publication_date": "2020-09-02", "related_identifiers": [{"identifier": "10.15760/etd.6353", "relation": "isSupplementTo", "resource_type": "publication-thesis", "scheme": "doi"}, {"identifier": "10.5281/zenodo.4012713", "relation": "isVersionOf", "scheme": "doi"}], "subjects": [{"identifier": "https://www.gbif.org/species/2863967", "scheme": "url", "term": "Eelgrass"}], "title": "Data for Mooring Impacts on Zostera marina Meadows and Associated Epifauna in Nantucket Harbor, Massachusetts, USA", "upload_type": "dataset"}, "modified": "2020-09-03T00:59:25.787627+00:00", "owner": 91267, "record_id": 4012714, "state": "done", "submitted": true, "title": "Data for Mooring Impacts on Zostera marina Meadows and Associated Epifauna in Nantucket Harbor, Massachusetts, USA"}, {"conceptdoi": "10.5281/zenodo.3988595", "conceptrecid": "3988595", "created": "2020-08-17T20:32:35.940429+00:00", "doi": "10.5281/zenodo.3988596", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3988596", "files": [{"checksum": "e76b679806a0a478bc783b3204d95d1a", "filename": "stevenson-et-al-nbi-report-2014.pdf", "filesize": 690075, "id": "3774ff0a-8b45-4b53-9e4d-34bba619e243", "links": {"download": "https://zenodo.org/api/files/0237287e-9344-4754-b3ea-206d23d78ca1/stevenson-et-al-nbi-report-2014.pdf", "self": "https://zenodo.org/api/deposit/depositions/3988596/files/3774ff0a-8b45-4b53-9e4d-34bba619e243"}}], "id": 3988596, "links": {"badge": "https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3988596.svg", "bucket": "https://zenodo.org/api/files/0237287e-9344-4754-b3ea-206d23d78ca1", "conceptbadge": "https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3988595.svg", "conceptdoi": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3988595", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3988596", "html": "https://zenodo.org/record/3988596", "latest": "https://zenodo.org/api/records/3988596", "latest_html": "https://zenodo.org/record/3988596", "self": "https://zenodo.org/api/records/3988596"}, "metadata": {"access_right": "open", "communities": [{"identifier": "nantucketbiodiversity"}], "creators": [{"affiliation": "University of Massachusetts Boston", "name": "Stevenson, Robert D."}, {"affiliation": "University of Massachusetts Boston", "name": "Lynam, Tim"}, {"affiliation": "University of Massachusetts Boston", "name": "Rodrigues, Luiz"}, {"affiliation": "University of Massachusetts Boston", "name": "Chow, Michele"}], "description": "<p>Submitted in fulfillment of a 2013 Nantucket Biodiversity Initiative grant.<br>\n<br>\nEllison (2012) found unexpectedly high ant diversity on Nantucket Island - about 50% of the species and 70% of the genera found in all of New England. The closely affiliated islands of Tuckernuck and Muskeget, while much smaller in size, might also be expected to have relatively high species diversity for their areas. Using the equilibrium island biogeography area equation, S=cAz, we predicted 16 to 33 species for Tuckernuck Island and 11 to 29 species for Muskeget Island.<br>\n<br>\nWe tested these predictions by sampling ants with pitfall traps, baits, hand collections and litter samples along ten transects on Tuckernuck and five transects on Muskeget. A total of 42 people-days of fieldwork were spread across four field trips in June, July, August and September of 2013. Among 3,935 specimens collected on Tuckernuck, we found 38 species. The most common species were Myrmica americana, Aphaenogaster rudis, Crematogaster lineolata, Lasius cf. niger, and Solenopsis cf. texana. Five species, including Lasius cf. niger, Camponotus pennsylvanicus, Camponotus neartica, Formica argentea, and Myrmica rubra, were not reported in Ellison&rsquo;s synthesis of Nantucket&rsquo;s ants. Among 16,621 specimens collected on Muskeget, we identified seven species all of which were also found on Tuckernuck. Muskeget&rsquo;s ant fauna is dominated by Crematogaster lineolata, which comprised 98% of the specimens, followed by Lasius cf. niger with 1.7% of the specimens.<br>\n<br>\nOur predictions of species diversity were underestimates for Tuckernuck (38 observed and 33 maximum predicted) and overestimates for Muskeget (11 minimum predicted and 7 observed). Using published equations of ant island biodiversity to predict diversity on Nantucket, Tuckernuck and Muskeget yielded results that were not consistent among the islands. Together our findings suggest area alone is not a good predictor of ant diversity on Tuckernuck and Muskeget. The higher than predicted diversity of ants for Tuckernuck may be the result of high habitat diversity for its area and lower human disturbance rates when compared to Nantucket and Muskeget.

A diverse AM community is a driver of a diverse plant community and understanding of the AM fungal community may prove useful in management of the sandplain grasslands of Nantucket Island, Massachusetts. The goal of the current research on Nantucket was two-fold: to document the density and biodiversity of mycorrhizal communities across the rare sandplain grassland on Nantucket, and to examine the potential mycorrhizal colonization in these same communities. The AM fungal community was measured in two ways: density of spores in the soils, and the colonization potential of the soils. Analysis of spore density differed by high and low cover classes of both shrubs and grasses. However, AM colonization potential, determined through AM fungal root colonization of corn (Zea mays L.), is not correlated with percent cover of any particular vegetation community type.

These heathlands are threatened by human development, shrub encroachment in the absence of disturbance, and potentially increasing soil nutrient levels. Sandplain heathlands are managed with prescribed fire, in order to maintain their open structure and maintain species diversity. In order to assess how past management was correlated with species change, I used a data set that spanned twenty years from three different heathlands in Massachusetts. I looked for correlations between management and species change. Correlations between species change and prescribed burning were very site, or microsite, specific, indicating that variables such as vegetation type and edaphic characteristics need to be taken into account before management is applied. Prescribed fire was also associated with an increase in ruderal species in one of the sites studied, indicating that there may be undesirable effects of prescribed fire in this system. Species diversity was negatively associated with shrub encroachment, reinforcing the importance of preventing shrubs from encroaching into these heathlands. I also found evidence that burning has not been a successful technique in preventing shrub encroachment in these sites. Lastly, the nitrophilic species Carex pensylvanica increased in all three sites, indicating that future studies should investigate the possibility that sandplain heathlands are currently experiencing nitrogen deposition beyond their critical loads.</p>", "doi": "10.5281/zenodo.3956821", "keywords": ["plantae", "flora", "massachusetts", "sesachacha heathlands wildlife sanctuary", "quadrat sampling", "management study", "nbi grant"], "language": "eng", "license": "CC-BY-4.0", "prereserve_doi": {"doi": "10.5281/zenodo.3956821", "recid": 3956821}, "publication_date": "2013-08-20", "publication_type": "report", "related_identifiers": [{"identifier": "https://stars.library.ucf.edu/etd/2658/", "relation": "isPartOf", "resource_type": "publication-thesis", "scheme": "url"}, {"identifier": "10.5281/zenodo.3956820", "relation": "isVersionOf", "scheme": "doi"}], "subjects": [{"identifier": "https://www.gbif.org/species/6", "scheme": "url", "term": "Plantae"}], "title": "Disturbance-based Management and Plant Species Change in Massachusetts Sandplain Heathlands Over the Past Two Decades", "upload_type": "publication"}, "modified": "2020-07-23T12:59:22.400872+00:00", "owner": 91267, "record_id": 3956821, "state": "done", "submitted": true, "title": "Disturbance-based Management and Plant Species Change in Massachusetts Sandplain Heathlands Over the Past Two Decades"}, {"conceptdoi": "10.5281/zenodo.3955322", "conceptrecid": "3955322", "created": "2020-07-22T02:51:49.352999+00:00", "doi": "10.5281/zenodo.3955323", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3955323", "files": [{"checksum": "80e6a5ceabd224431ec6db4b449bec2d", "filename": "allRAPData.csv", "filesize": 27932, "id": "894c83b0-944e-4f53-8c7c-b477695737aa", "links": {"download": "https://zenodo.org/api/files/22fba70d-6076-4d8a-aa3c-cf4f7f5160f4/allRAPData.csv", "self": "https://zenodo.org/api/deposit/depositions/3955323/files/894c83b0-944e-4f53-8c7c-b477695737aa"}}, {"checksum": "87e69ff64265ab490a057cf7a3e7394c", "filename": "dataDictionary.csv", "filesize": 907, "id": "f06465ca-f0a2-455c-8335-3b2c639fbb0e", "links": {"download": "https://zenodo.org/api/files/22fba70d-6076-4d8a-aa3c-cf4f7f5160f4/dataDictionary.csv", "self": "https://zenodo.org/api/deposit/depositions/3955323/files/f06465ca-f0a2-455c-8335-3b2c639fbb0e"}}, {"checksum": "1b72a716869b08cd3ee3fae492e79282", "filename": "mckennafoster-draney-nbi-report-2010.pdf", "filesize": 356665, "id": "458e0d28-d740-48b4-b2d8-00a2168c7887", "links": {"download": "https://zenodo.org/api/files/22fba70d-6076-4d8a-aa3c-cf4f7f5160f4/mckennafoster-draney-nbi-report-2010.pdf", "self": "https://zenodo.org/api/deposit/depositions/3955323/files/458e0d28-d740-48b4-b2d8-00a2168c7887"}}], "id": 3955323, "links": {"badge": "https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3955323.svg", "bucket": "https://zenodo.org/api/files/22fba70d-6076-4d8a-aa3c-cf4f7f5160f4", "conceptbadge": "https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3955322.svg", "conceptdoi": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3955322", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3955323", "html": "https://zenodo.org/record/3955323", "latest": "https://zenodo.org/api/records/3955323", "latest_html": "https://zenodo.org/record/3955323", "self": "https://zenodo.org/api/records/3955323"}, "metadata": {"access_right": "open", "communities": [{"identifier": "nantucketbiodiversity"}], "creators": [{"affiliation": "Maria Mitchell Association", "name": "Mckenna-Foster, Andrew", "orcid": "0000-0001-7641-6588"}, {"affiliation": "University of Wisconsin-Green Bay", "name": "Draney, Michael", "orcid": "0000-0002-1740-7064"}], "description": "<p>Submitted in fulfillment of a 2009 Nantucket Biodiversity Initiative grant.<br>\n<br>\nWe tested a Rapid Assessment Protocol for Spiders and Millipedes (RAPSM) in sandplain grassland and coastal heathland on Nantucket Island, Massachusetts. The objective of this protocol is to efficiently capture most of the available species within a defined area and provide species diversity datasets that are comparable between habitats. The RAPSM requires a combination of two person-hours of litter sorting and one person-hour of hand collecting (sweep-netting) in individual 100 m2 circular plots. We collected 538 spiders representing 36 species (188 were identifiable) from seven plots. The average number of spiders collected (adult and juvenile) per plot was 77 and the average number of species per plot was 12. On average, there are 0.77 spiders per square meter of sandplain grassland and coastal heathland within our study area. Litter sorting produced the most complete collection as indicated by accumulation curves. The RAPSM species list contains 71 percent of the species in a season adjusted species list for the study area and they are 58 percent similar. Our data suggest there is high beta diversity in the sandplain grassland and coastal heathland habitat.

Microscopic and molecular analyses were applied to identify the cyanobacterium and describe its phylogenetic position, and to characterize the microbial communities associated with it. The morphological observations in parallel with 16S rRNA and nifH results suggest that the cyanobacterium is closely related to Hydrocoleum sp. (Oscillatoriales, Phormidiaceae), with the closest previously described relative Hydrocoleum lyngbyaceum, and appears to represent a unique strain. The genus is a ubiquitous benthic cyanobacterium in tropical and subtropical waters and coral reefs, where it is at times considered a nuisance, while these observations in North Atlantic temperate waters may represent an expansion of its habitat range. Amplicon sequencing targeting the nifH gene confirmed that the cyanobacterium is capable of fixing N2, and also hosts a relatively diverse community of nifH-gene containing bacteria typifying microbial mat diazotroph communities growing in association with it. Hydrocoleum was recently reported to be a potential producer of homoanatoxin-a, a neurotoxin, but genes for these toxins were not detected in the communities investigated in this study. Increasing sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic Ocean may have contributed to this potential expansion of Hydrocoleum sp. habitat range.</p>", "doi": "10.5281/zenodo.3942680", "keywords": ["bacteria", "nantucket", "genetics study", "genetic sequencing", "nbi grant"], "language": "eng", "license": "CC-BY-4.0", "prereserve_doi": {"doi": "10.5281/zenodo.3942680", "recid": 3942680}, "publication_date": "2015-02-15", "publication_type": "report", "related_identifiers": [{"identifier": "10.5281/zenodo.3942679", "relation": "isVersionOf", "scheme": "doi"}], "subjects": [{"identifier": "https://www.gbif.org/species/68", "scheme": "url", "term": "Cyanobacteria"}], "title": "Genomic Characterization of Filamentous Cyanobacteria on Nantucket Beaches", "upload_type": "publication"}, "modified": "2020-07-14T00:59:19.724810+00:00", "owner": 91267, "record_id": 3942680, "state": "done", "submitted": true, "title": "Genomic Characterization of Filamentous Cyanobacteria on Nantucket Beaches"}, {"conceptdoi": "10.5281/zenodo.3942675", "conceptrecid": "3942675", "created": "2020-07-13T22:30:38.102599+00:00", "doi": "10.5281/zenodo.3942676", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3942676", "files": [{"checksum": "a3ddd83925b32c73b1bc39b737340b44", "filename": "moisander-nbi-report-2012.pdf", "filesize": 1772430, "id": "d1ceb955-e0dd-4cf5-b2e7-265a0870d64e", "links": {"download": "https://zenodo.org/api/files/033d7f65-65a1-43ee-9e97-22c3279ba8a1/moisander-nbi-report-2012.pdf", "self": "https://zenodo.org/api/deposit/depositions/3942676/files/d1ceb955-e0dd-4cf5-b2e7-265a0870d64e"}}], "id": 3942676, "links": {"badge": "https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3942676.svg", "bucket": "https://zenodo.org/api/files/033d7f65-65a1-43ee-9e97-22c3279ba8a1", "conceptbadge": "https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3942675.svg", "conceptdoi": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3942675", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3942676", "html": "https://zenodo.org/record/3942676", "latest": "https://zenodo.org/api/records/3942676", "latest_html": "https://zenodo.org/record/3942676", "self": "https://zenodo.org/api/records/3942676"}, "metadata": {"access_right": "open", "communities": [{"identifier": "nantucketbiodiversity"}], "creators": [{"affiliation": "University of Massachusetts Dartmouth", "name": "Moisander, Pia"}], "description": "<p>This report was submitted in fulfillment of a 2011 Nantucket Biodiversity Initiative grant.<br>\n<br>\nThe main goal of this project was to investigate diversity of potentially toxic cyanobacteria on Nantucket Island.

This information is valuable because exotic and native earthworms are spreading into previously wormless ecosystems, drastically altering soil composition and litter depths. On Nantucket and Tuckernuck, where some of the largest remaining tracts of the rare sandplain grassland and coastal heathland are located, the ability of earthworms to colonize these habitats as well as their subsequent effect on ecosystem processes is unknown. We used a liquid mustard extraction method to collect earthworms in five biodiversity plots on Nantucket and in several locations across Tuckernuck. Casual collections supplemented our datasets. We identified five exotic species from 123 total specimens (61 adult; 42 identifiable juveniles; 20 unidentifiable juveniles). No specimens represented native species. We found earthworms where we expected-- near human dominated landscapes and in wet forests/swamps. In the dry sandplain grassland and heathland habitat we only found earthworms at one plot, suggesting that earthworms are able to survive in this habitat. More data is needed to better document the distribution and effect of these species.

During the 2009 summer, we counted and marked pursewebs in 27 square meter quadrats on Tuckernuck. Quadrat locations were carefully recorded so that they can be revisited over the next decade to monitor individual S. rufipes spiders within the larger colony. The goal is to record how long a spider stays in one place, how web densities change spatially, and determine average individual longevity.

Sandplain grassland is a globally rare habitat that is abundant on Nantucket Island, Massachusetts and the abundance of terrestrial isopods in the habitat has never been studied. The objective of this project was to develop a model to explain isopod abundance based on vegetation characteristics within Sandplain grassland and use this model to test for land management effects (prescribed burning and mowing) on isopod abundance. I counted terrestrial isopods from 175 pitfall traps set for one week and used multiple linear regression with several selection algorithms to select the best model. The vegetation characteristics I used as regressors do not appear to explain terrestrial abundance well and the final model only contains the percent grass coverage as a regressor. The model suggests that terrestrial isopods decrease in abundance with increasing grass coverage and it explains 29 percent of the data.

It is disturbance dependent and prescribed burning and mowing are management techniques used to impede shrub encroachment and maintain grassland. We used pitfall traps to investigate the effects of one time burning and mowing, annual mowing, and no management on spider richness and abundance in sandplain grasslands located in the Smooth Hummocks Coastal Preserve on Nantucket Island. In 2352 trap nights, we captured 1663 spiders representing 67 species. Burned treatments had significantly higher abundance because the most abundant species, Pardosa saxatilis (Lycosidae) was almost exclusively captured in burned areas. Accounting for P. saxatilis, abundance and richness were similar across all treatments. Guild structure was also very similar. In a correspondence analysis, we identified species that prefer recently managed grassland and those that prefer less recently managed grassland and conclude that maintaining several treatments in the area increases overall spider diversity.

Since the early 1900&rsquo;s the breeding range of the American Oystercatcher, Haematopus palliatus, has expanded north along the Atlantic Coast. Since the 1970&rsquo;s the species has assumed a prominent role as a nesting shorebird along the Atlantic Coast including Cape Cod, Massachusetts and the surrounding islands. We examined the productivity and movement of a population of oystercatchers from 2005-2007 in Nantucket County, Massachusetts. From 2005 to 2007, a total of 144 oystercatchers (100 adults, 44 juveniles) were individually marked using a coded color band. Movement during the breeding season and persistence of oystercatchers at nesting grounds were recorded for marked individuals. Auxiliary markings continue to provide new information about nest site fidelity and have the potential to provide information about the population dynamics of the oystercatcher in Massachusetts. Of the 67 adults marked in 2005-2006, 43 (64.2%) have been resighted during the non-breeding season in an array of sites throughout the accepted winter distribution. In 2006, 20 of 26 marked adults returned to their respected beaches in Nantucket County, which supports a characteristic often assumed for the American Oystercatcher, breeding site fidelity. This measure of fidelity (or return rate) can be used as an early, baseline estimate of adult survival. Based on this mark-resight model for estimating return rate, adult survival is &ge;0.77 (0.084 SE).</p>", "doi": "10.5281/zenodo.3841179", "keywords": ["cape and islands", "nantucket", "tuckernuck", "muskeget", "banding", "animalia", "decoy trap", "nbi grant", "population dynamics", "new england coast", "animalia", "birds"], "language": "eng", "license": "CC-BY-4.0", "prereserve_doi": {"doi": "10.5281/zenodo.3841179", "recid": 3841179}, "publication_date": "2009-01-21", "publication_type": "report", "related_identifiers": [{"identifier": "10.5281/zenodo.3841178", "relation": "isVersionOf", "scheme": "doi"}], "subjects": [{"identifier": "https://www.gbif.org/species/2480273", "scheme": "url", "term": "American Oystercatcher"}], "title": "Dispersal and population dynamics of the New England American oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus)", "upload_type": "publication"}, "modified": "2020-07-01T17:13:20.226624+00:00", "owner": 91267, "record_id": 3841179, "state": "done", "submitted": true, "title": "Dispersal and population dynamics of the New England American oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus)"}, {"conceptdoi": "10.5281/zenodo.3840634", "conceptrecid": "3840634", "created": "2020-05-22T23:37:33.693378+00:00", "doi": "10.5281/zenodo.3840635", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3840635", "files": [{"checksum": "c224bffcab40fe91e4eb25924392ff2f", "filename": "smyers-nbi-report-2010.pdf", "filesize": 9675, "id": "11027b8d-708f-45c2-88e9-b35887847e8e", "links": {"download": "https://zenodo.org/api/files/78ac606a-5a0c-4135-923c-b506149efe8e/smyers-nbi-report-2010.pdf", "self": "https://zenodo.org/api/deposit/depositions/3840635/files/11027b8d-708f-45c2-88e9-b35887847e8e"}}], "id": 3840635, "links": {"badge": "https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3840635.svg", "bucket": "https://zenodo.org/api/files/78ac606a-5a0c-4135-923c-b506149efe8e", "conceptbadge": "https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3840634.svg", "conceptdoi": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3840634", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3840635", "html": "https://zenodo.org/record/3840635", "latest": "https://zenodo.org/api/records/3840635", "latest_html": "https://zenodo.org/record/3840635", "self": "https://zenodo.org/api/records/3840635"}, "metadata": {"access_right": "open", "communities": [{"identifier": "nantucketbiodiversity"}], "creators": [{"affiliation": "Oxbow Associates", "name": "Smyers, Scott"}], "description": "<p>Report submitted in fulfillment of a 2009&nbsp;Nantucket Biodiversity Initiative grant.</p>\n\n<p>Amphibians are very sensitive to temperature, moisture, and environmental contamination.

Documenting amphibian breeding phenology and reproductive effort will provide excellent reference data for longterm studies of how frog communities respond to environmental variability. I predict that research on population and reproductive biology of amphibians will be more likely to detect changes at one of these study sites because each represents the extreme limits of New England habitat zones.

Gaylussacia baccata (black huckleberry) is a dominant species in coastal heathland and forms large clonal monocultures. As these clones expand they replace grassland and reduce overall plant species diversity. In this pilot study I captured spiders in different size classes of G. baccata clones to determine if clone size affects spider species diversity. I also recorded differences in major plant species. Smaller clones had significantly higher numbers of two wolf spider species: Pardosa saxatilis and Schizocosa bilineata. Smaller clones tended to have a higher number of spider species than larger clones. Smaller clones had higher percentages of grass cover and less G. baccata coverage. I suggest that future work should produce separate species area curves for sandplain grassland and coastal heathland habitats to determine an optimum ratio of areas to maximize spider species richness.</p>\n\n<p>allSpiderData.csv<br>\ndataDictionary.csv - Data dictionary for all data files<br>\nmckenna-foster-report-2009.pdf - report describing project<br>\nvegetationData.csv</p>", "doi": "10.5281/zenodo.3802029", "keywords": ["smooth hummocks coastal preserve", "pitfall traps", "species survey", "quadrat sampling", "animalia", "nantucket", "invertebrates"], "language": "eng", "license": "CC-BY-4.0", "prereserve_doi": {"doi": "10.5281/zenodo.3802029", "recid": 3802029}, "publication_date": "2009-01-01", "related_identifiers": [{"identifier": "10.5281/zenodo.3802028", "relation": "isVersionOf", "scheme": "doi"}], "subjects": [{"identifier": "https://www.gbif.org/species/2882739", "scheme": "url", "term": "Gaylussacia baccata"}, {"identifier": "https://www.gbif.org/species/1496", "scheme": "url", "term": "Araneae"}], "title": "Spider species composition in Gaylussacia baccata clones of varying sizes on Nantucket Island, Massachusetts", "upload_type": "dataset"}, "modified": "2020-07-01T16:56:37.044411+00:00", "owner": 91267, "record_id": 3802029, "state": "done", "submitted": true, "title": "Spider species composition in Gaylussacia baccata clones of varying sizes on Nantucket Island, Massachusetts"}, {"conceptdoi": "10.5281/zenodo.3783800", "conceptrecid": "3783800", "created": "2020-05-04T00:07:04.923335+00:00", "doi": "10.5281/zenodo.3783801", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3783801", "files": [{"checksum": "153f6aa93b0a0ee0cb9a99ad4b98e166", "filename": "weed-nbi-report-2006.pdf", "filesize": 2182795, "id": "da57284c-9d03-4d7e-b23e-1296a6eb1d7f", "links": {"download": "https://zenodo.org/api/files/a47f9971-164e-4b03-bb89-85d28f434e14/weed-nbi-report-2006.pdf", "self": "https://zenodo.org/api/deposit/depositions/3783801/files/da57284c-9d03-4d7e-b23e-1296a6eb1d7f"}}], "id": 3783801, "links": {"badge": "https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3783801.svg", "bucket": "https://zenodo.org/api/files/a47f9971-164e-4b03-bb89-85d28f434e14", "conceptbadge": "https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3783800.svg", "conceptdoi": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3783800", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3783801", "html": "https://zenodo.org/record/3783801", "latest": "https://zenodo.org/api/records/3783801", "latest_html": "https://zenodo.org/record/3783801", "self": "https://zenodo.org/api/records/3783801"}, "metadata": {"access_right": "open", "communities": [{"identifier": "nantucketbiodiversity"}], "creators": [{"affiliation": "University of Rhode Island", "name": "Weed, Aaron"}], "description": "<p>Report submitted in fulfillment of a 2005&nbsp;Nantucket Biodiversity Initiative grant.<br>\n<br>\nThe objectives of this study were to sample above ground insects over one growing season on Nantucket in terrestrial plant communities that represent various habitats of the pitch pine/scrub oak barrens.

S. niger is hard to find and understudied and S. rufipes is at its most extreme northern range on Tuckernuck. With support from the Nantucket Biodiversity Initiative, the Maria Mitchell Association, and the Tuckernuck Land Trust, we spent part of the summer in 2007 trapping for extremely cryptic S. niger on Nantucket in hopes of finding an area where we could uncover their tube webs. In addition to 336 pitfall trap-nights in three locations, we also completed five hours of searching in likely habitat for the tubes. We did not find any tubes but we did trap three more male specimens from two new locations and recorded an approximate wandering week in 2007 for the males of 6-14 June. We also accumulated 11 hours of search time in likely habitat looking for tubes of S. rufipes on Nantucket, without success. During a trip to Tuckernuck we repeated a 2006 survey of S. rufipes tubes and counted about 50 within 100 m2. This tube density is very rare for the species and leads us to wonder if some of the tubes are S. niger.

(House Mouse) or Colinus virginianus (Bobwhite Quail) in the summer of 2016. We aimed to identify vertebrate scavenger species, measure how long carcasses remained available, and examine differences in carrion consumption between grassland and shrubland vegetation types. This information is important for management decisions concerning a reintroduced population of a federally endangered obligate scavenger, Nicrophorus americanus (American Burying Beetle), on Nantucket Island. Carcasses were removed or consumed within 2.7 &plusmn; 1.8 d, and vertebrates removed the carcass in 74% of trials. Carcasses persisted for similar lengths of time between the 2 vegetation types, but avian scavengers were significantly more common on Bobwhite Quail carcasses in grassland, and mammalian scavengers were significantly more common on House Mouse carcasses in shrubland habitats.

This form of <em>Gonionemus</em> was not associated with painful stings, despite frequent handling by scientists and collectors. An invasion of a more toxic form of <em>Gonionemus</em> appears to have occurred in the late 1980s in the Cape Cod region. Several individuals have reported <em>Gonionemus</em> stings in parts of Waquoit Bay (Cape Cod) and Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard, but none to date have been recorded from Nantucket. Jellyfish surveys were coordinated with Mary Carman (WHOI) who conducted a parallel NBI study on the distribution and abundance of invasive tunicates in eelgrass meadows on Nantucket and Muskeget Islands. Despite extensive searching, no <em>Gonionemus</em> were found on either Nantucket or Muskeget. However, a broader genetic analysis of regional <em>Gonionemus</em> populations indicated the presence of multiple lineages, one of which is shared with well-known toxic populations in the Sea of Japan. The unique lineages indicated that native <em>Gonionemus</em> diversity also likely exists in the area. While no <em>Gonionemus</em> were found on Nantucket or Muskeget, it is possible that <em>Gonionemus</em> may arrive in the near future. The life cycle of <em>Gonionemus</em> includes minute asexual stages which could easily hitchhike on ship hulls and other vectors. Monitoring eelgrass habitats will facilitate early detection, so that mitigation measures can be most effectively applied.</p>", "doi": "10.5281/zenodo.3753187", "keywords": ["nantucket", "muskeget", "species survey", "field observation", "nbi grant", "animalia", "genetics study", "marine fauna"], "language": "eng", "license": "CC-BY-4.0", "prereserve_doi": {"doi": "10.5281/zenodo.3753187", "recid": 3753187}, "publication_date": "2017-02-15", "publication_type": "report", "related_identifiers": [{"identifier": "10.5281/zenodo.3753186", "relation": "isVersionOf", "scheme": "doi"}], "title": "Distribution and genetic diversity of the invasive clinging jellyfish Gonionemus vertens on Nantucket and Muskeget Islands", "upload_type": "publication"}, "modified": "2020-07-10T16:25:10.064351+00:00", "owner": 91267, "record_id": 3753187, "state": "done", "submitted": true, "title": "Distribution and genetic diversity of the invasive clinging jellyfish Gonionemus vertens on Nantucket and Muskeget Islands"}, {"conceptdoi": "10.5281/zenodo.3753098", "conceptrecid": "3753098", "created": "2020-04-15T16:17:32.568678+00:00", "doi": "10.5281/zenodo.3753099", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3753099", "files": [{"checksum": "508ee318ae6e44367e74475571148095", "filename": "allSurveyData.csv", "filesize": 28825, "id": "5c46e348-8dfa-4bbf-8133-2817bd7bb0f1", "links": {"download": "https://zenodo.org/api/files/5f1afd74-e651-4237-9eb6-92bf7dfd73c8/allSurveyData.csv", "self": "https://zenodo.org/api/deposit/depositions/3753099/files/5c46e348-8dfa-4bbf-8133-2817bd7bb0f1"}}, {"checksum": "8c78d4cf6a706519ec273fa366ed5b11", "filename": "Blyth-and-LoPresti-2013.pdf", "filesize": 505462, "id": "aba13e58-89f5-4123-9178-7295c4a9d7d7", "links": {"download": "https://zenodo.org/api/files/5f1afd74-e651-4237-9eb6-92bf7dfd73c8/Blyth-and-LoPresti-2013.pdf", "self": "https://zenodo.org/api/deposit/depositions/3753099/files/aba13e58-89f5-4123-9178-7295c4a9d7d7"}}, {"checksum": "bfede512c00988e0ab226578cbf3626d", "filename": "comparativeSpeciesList.csv", "filesize": 4503, "id": "052c4ed5-31fa-4f51-bd52-8a00e2c2ae32", "links": {"download": "https://zenodo.org/api/files/5f1afd74-e651-4237-9eb6-92bf7dfd73c8/comparativeSpeciesList.csv", "self": "https://zenodo.org/api/deposit/depositions/3753099/files/052c4ed5-31fa-4f51-bd52-8a00e2c2ae32"}}, {"checksum": "3d8d87939d75ce30a7345ebae7b2bc81", "filename": "dataDictionary.csv", "filesize": 3368, "id": "59f7045c-b668-421d-a33c-602c2d2f7c82", "links": {"download": "https://zenodo.org/api/files/5f1afd74-e651-4237-9eb6-92bf7dfd73c8/dataDictionary.csv", "self": "https://zenodo.org/api/deposit/depositions/3753099/files/59f7045c-b668-421d-a33c-602c2d2f7c82"}}, {"checksum": "7fb92277a983c210e69ce0a8f44649d2", "filename": "keyedExuviae.csv", "filesize": 16154, "id": "8b62921c-3228-4274-8d7e-9e8cd524546d", "links": {"download": "https://zenodo.org/api/files/5f1afd74-e651-4237-9eb6-92bf7dfd73c8/keyedExuviae.csv", "self": "https://zenodo.org/api/deposit/depositions/3753099/files/8b62921c-3228-4274-8d7e-9e8cd524546d"}}], "id": 3753099, "links": {"badge": "https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3753099.svg", "bucket": "https://zenodo.org/api/files/5f1afd74-e651-4237-9eb6-92bf7dfd73c8", "conceptbadge": "https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3753098.svg", "conceptdoi": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3753098", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3753099", "html": "https://zenodo.org/record/3753099", "latest": "https://zenodo.org/api/records/3753099", "latest_html": "https://zenodo.org/record/3753099", "self": "https://zenodo.org/api/records/3753099"}, "metadata": {"access_right": "open", "communities": [{"identifier": "nantucketbiodiversity"}], "contributors": [{"affiliation": "Maria Mitchell Association", "name": "Mckenna-Foster, Andrew", "orcid": "0000-0001-7641-6588", "type": "DataCurator"}], "creators": [{"affiliation": "Maria Mitchell Association", "name": "Blyth, Julia"}, {"affiliation": "Maria Mitchell Association", "name": "LoPresti, Eric", "orcid": "0000-0002-5622-0278"}], "description": "<p>Report and data submitted in fulfillment of a 2012 Nantucket Biodiversity Initiative grant.</p>\n\n<p>The first comprehensive survey of Odonates (dragonflies and damselflies) on Nantucket Island occurred in 1917.

Contrary to most previously published literature on <em>S. rufipes,</em> we noted the predominance of the grass-like sedge, <em>Carex pensylvanica,</em> rather than trees, as a web support.&nbsp; However, we also offer the first report of <em>S. rufipes </em>using a conifer (<em>Pinus rigida</em>) as a web support.&nbsp; Coleopterans and isopods made up 79 percent of the prey parts collected from 56 pursewebs. &nbsp;We suggest that the Tuckernuck population offers an opportunity to collect important long-term demographic data.</p>\n\n<p>Datasets:<br>\nsphodrosWebLocations.csv - data from two specific areas<br>\nsphodrosSpiderMeasurements.csv - measurements of live spiders borrowed from their webs<br>\nsphodrosRandomWebLocations.csv - data for webs found by happenstance<br>\nsphodrosDiet.csv - diet data from body parts collected from Sphodros webs<br>\nsphodrosDataDictionary.csv</p>", "doi": "10.5281/zenodo.3745607", "journal_issue": "1", "journal_pages": "171-173", "journal_title": "Journal of Arachnology", "journal_volume": "39", "keywords": ["tuckernuck", "field observation", "animalia", "diet", "population survey", "invertebrates", "nbi grant"], "language": "eng", "license": "CC-BY-4.0", "prereserve_doi": {"doi": "10.5281/zenodo.3745607", "recid": 3745607}, "publication_date": "2020-04-08", "related_identifiers": [{"identifier": "10.1636/P10-15.1", "relation": "isDocumentedBy", "resource_type": "publication-article", "scheme": "doi"}, {"identifier": "10.5281/zenodo.3745606", "relation": "isVersionOf", "scheme": "doi"}], "subjects": [{"identifier": "https://www.gbif.org/species/2167266", "scheme": "url", "term": "Sphodros rufipes"}], "title": "Data for an unusually dense population of Sphodros rufipes  (Latreille 1829) (Mygalomorphae, Atypidae) at the edge of its range on Tuckernuck Island, Massachusetts", "upload_type": "dataset"}, "modified": "2020-09-29T18:23:40.552518+00:00", "owner": 91267, "record_id": 3745607, "state": "done", "submitted": true, "title": "Data for an unusually dense population of Sphodros rufipes  (Latreille 1829) (Mygalomorphae, Atypidae) at the edge of its range on Tuckernuck Island, Massachusetts"}]
